Main reference for this task: https://github.com/jitsi/docker-jitsi-meet/tree/master/examples/kubernetes

Created two base images:
fhirfactory/pegacorn-base-java-docker-jitsi:1.0.0
fhirfactory/pegacorn-base-docker-jitsi:1.0.0

4 major components:
- Prosody
- Jicofo
- Jitsi-videobridge (JVB)
- Web (Nginx)

Requisites:
- Generated domain certificate and key using LetsEncrypt. (This would be replaced by certs from SSICT)

Prosody:
- Removed sections that auto-generate certs from LetsEncrypt
- Main file is prosody.cfg.lua (can we mount this and apply changes without rebuilding image?). Several modifications applied.

Jicofo:
- No changes

Jitsi-videobridge:
- In jvb.conf, changed port under public settings from 9090 to 9095.
Port 9090 was already in use for me (This may not apply in other environments)

Web:
- Installed nano (used during testing)
- Updated settings in meet.conf (Ref: https://prosody.im/doc/setting_up_bosh)
- Updated ssl.conf to use acquired certificates. Removed all entries to generate certs via LetsEncrypt on the fly
- Updated 10-config. Removed script section to generate certs using LETSENCRYPT

Helm:
- Created separate yaml service file for UDP connections
- Node port values are statically supplied to the Public URL and BOSH http-bind address (This should not be required with proper load balancing)
